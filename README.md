## part 1: Me!
Hi everyone! Aierwa here.  
Firstly, please don't laugh at my Chinglish when you scan this article.  

"Aierwa" is the full-PinYin of a expression above love. My real name is Xu Xiang. I come from countryside Su JiaYan, XiangShan town, SheHong county, SiChuan province, China. Â  

I was born in 1991 as a genuine post-90s. Oh God, the post-00s are making money, marrying, watching a baby.....till this moment. I'm much happier than others as a infant student, at least that's what my GF always talking about. >.<.  

To stay in lovely SiChuan, stay with my friends, stay with she, I strongly chose SiChuan University for my first choice after college entrance examination. Lucky boy, I got the golden offer from SCU.  
SCU is the most beautiful and largest university I have ever seen, including JiangAn, WangJiang and HuaXi campus.  

For a not bad student in 4-years undergraduate learning in the College of Polymer Science and Engeneering, I gained a qualification to start my graduate study for 3 years. Haha, my original thought is to be a scientist in my major, but unexpectively, I never dreamed that I am being a coder. Life is always amazing.  

A little shy boy with a enthusiastic heart to life.  
Quiet, lyrical, amiable, also athletic, rocky, perceptual.  

There's lots of things in my amateur life: reading, riding, basketball, mahjong, daze...  

I am a fatalism, and you are my destiny.
