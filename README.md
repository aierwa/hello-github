## part 1: Me!
Hi everyone! Aierwa here.  
Firstly, please don't laugh at my Chinglish when you scan this article.  

"Aierwa" is the full-PinYin of a expression above love. My real name is Xu Xiang. I come from countryside Su JiaYan, XiangShan town, SheHong county, SiChuan province, China.   

I was born in 1991 as a genuine post-90s. Oh God, the post-00s are making money, marrying, watching a baby.....till this moment. I'm much happier than others as a infant student, at least that's what my GF always talking about. >.<.  

To stay in lovely SiChuan, stay with my friends, stay with her, I strongly chose SiChuan University for my first choice after college entrance examination. Lucky boy, I got the golden offer from SCU.  
SCU is the most beautiful and largest university I have ever seen, including JiangAn, WangJiang and HuaXi campus.  

For a not bad student in 4-years undergraduate learning in the College of Polymer Science and Engeneering, I gained a qualification to start my graduate study for 3 years. Haha, my original thought is to be a scientist in my major, but unexpectively, I never dreamed that I am being a coder. Life is always amazing.  

A little shy boy with a enthusiastic heart to life.  
Quiet, lyrical, amiable, also athletic, rocky, perceptual.  

There's lots of things in my amateur life: dating, reading, riding, basketball, mahjong, daze...  

I am a fatalism, and you are my destiny.

## part 2: FE
One day, a road to FE/coder arose in front of me. Please allow me to keep before and after the beginning as a small secret. Anyway, this road looks good to me.  

At first, I use txt editor to write my first <code>HTML</code> file, it's a amazing moment when the words I wrote were presented in browser. After a few seconds, I could already realize a jump link via tag <code>a</code>, a beautiful image via tag <code>img</code>.  
<code>CSS</code> is fantastic. Whereafter, I could control the distance of sections, border, color, background, font size. The following position, float, dispay were more attractive.  
For the first time accessing <code>JavaScrit</code>, I know maybe that was what I want. Some codes actually could alert a box with "hello world". Function was a magical black box which could realize your ideas.  
After months of learing, I thought that maybe I should be a coder(programmer) rather than a polymer scientist. The idea grew, grew, at least grew up. I decided a career change, leaving my 7-years study in my own major(in faith, i was not interested in polymer).  

The first step was that an advanced development should be needed. After a few months, I had learned more JS, html5, css/css3, further more, superficial nodejs, react, webpack and so on. I'd like to know that how much relevant knowledge was there in FE's world as much as possible. And then I restored some pages for exercises. One of these was a simplified website system of Xiaomi(xiaomi.com). From back-end to front-end, staic content to js animation, web presentation to mysql database, search page to cart page, user register to user login, in my view anyway, it looked relatively complete.  

Summer vacation of 2016 was coming(in other words, the fall recruitment was also coming). Maybe I needed a pratical training in some certain company with real projects. But the question was that how should I tell my supervisor this "bad" news? Finally I chose to be a frank man.  
One night after our weekly group meeting, I told him that I had something private in a fear. A chair beside one garden became the position of negotiation. Thanks god, he understood my thoughts. It was a pleasant talk.  

It was difficult to gain an offer. I delivered over 1000 individual resumes via network and after the everyday packed interviews, I received two or three offers. Finally I worked in supermap(Chengdu) as a real web-developer for more than two months. That sounds great, isn't it?  

With a internship experience, it was a litte bit smoother to apply for a full-time job in the next fall recruitment.  

The road to FE is very long, particularly when you are in it. But I will keep going, and live a meaningful life.
